### Reflection
A for loop is a helpful tool in completing this assignment. A range function also helps, as it gives the for loop a number to use for each instance it runs. For example, a for loop with a range function from 1 - 10 
```python 
for i in range(1, 10)
```
would assign the variable given to a for loop for each number between 1 and 9. So on the first time through the loop i would be one, on the second it would be 2, etc. It only goes up to 9 because on 9 the loop will have run ten times because it includes the first 1. A for loop automatically steps by 1, ie adds 1 each time, but you can change that by adding a third parameter.
